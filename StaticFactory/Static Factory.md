Static Factory Method is a constructive design pattern that provides a static method for creating objects. This method is an alternative to using a direct constructor to create objects, and offers several benefits, including improved code clarity and multiple ways to create objects of the same type.

### Benefits:

2. **Better control over creation**: You can add complex logic inside a static factory method.

3. **Object reuse**: You can use objects created
