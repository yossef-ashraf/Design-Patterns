Bridge
PURPOSE
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the
two can vary independently. The bridge pattern allows the
Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed
independently and the client code can access only the
Abstraction part without being concerned about the
Implementation part.
Publish abstraction interface in a separate
Inheritance hierarchy, and put the implementatio
In its own inheritance hierarchy.
