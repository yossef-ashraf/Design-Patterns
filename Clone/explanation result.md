#### Code

```php

#### Explanation of the outcomes

1. **Original engine primary outputs**:
 ```
 Original Car Engine Horsepower: 150
 Original Car Engine Speed: 200
 ```
 - These are the original values ​​of the engine before any reproduction or modification was made.

2. **Surface cloning and modifying values**:
 ```
 Shallow Cloned Car Engine Horsepower: 200
 Original Car Engine Horsepower after shallow clone modification: 200
 Shallow Cloned Car Engine Speed: 400
 Original Car Engine Fast after shallow clone modification: 400
 ```
 - When performing a surface clone, the reference to the `engine` object is copied from the original object to the clone. Therefore, when we modify the values ​​of `horsepower` and `fast` in the clone, these modifications also affect the original object, because the clone and the original object share the same `engine` object.

3. **Deep cloning and modifying values**:
 ```
 Deep Cloned Car Engine Horsepower: 250
 Original Car Engine Horsepower after deep clone modification: 200
 Deep Cloned Car Engine Speed: 700
 Original Car Engine Fast after deep clone modification: 400
 ```
 - When deep cloning is performed, a new, independent copy of the `engine` object is created for the cloned object. Therefore, when we deeply modify the values ​​of `horsepower` and `fast` in the clone, these modifications do not affect the original object. The `horsepower` and `fast` values ​​in the original object remain the same after modification in the deep clone.

### summary
- **Skinny Cloning**: Only the reference is copied, which means that any modification to the cloned object will affect the original object and vice versa.
- **Deep Cloning**: Child objects are copied independently, which means that modifications to the cloned object do not affect the original object.

Deep cloning is useful when you need to create new, completely independent objects without affecting the original objects.
