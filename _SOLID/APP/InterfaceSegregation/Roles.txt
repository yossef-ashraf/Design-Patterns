                                                       - Interface Segregation Principle - 

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they
don't use. Instead of having a large, general-purpose interface, break it down into smaller,
more specialized interfaces that meet the needs of specific clients.
This principle is intended to promote modular, flexible, and maintainable software design.
It is a part of SOLID principles of object-oriented design.
